== Dotfiles

Some of my dotfiles. Have a look at my https://blog.sebastian-daschner.com/entries/effective-keyboard-usage-video-course[video course^] on effective developer keyboard usage.

=== IntelliJ Live templates

Copy the live templates into your IDEA configuration directory, under `<config-dir>/config/jba_config/templates/`.

NOTE: In IntelliJ `2020.1` the default configuration directory has changed: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/tuning-the-ide.html#default-dirs.
For Linux, the default is now `~/.config/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea20XX.X/`

The `config/jba_config/templates.xml` files exists to avoid collisions with predefined default templates. You might have to merge in the parts of the XML file manually.
